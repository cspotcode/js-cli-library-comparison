Excluding search results that match a qualifier

In a browser, the GitHub search syntax supports excluding results that match a search qualifier by prefixing the qualifier with a hyphen. For example, to search for issues that do not have the label "bug", you would use \`-label:bug\` as a search qualifier.

\`gh\` supports this syntax in \`gh search\` as well, but it requires extra command line arguments to avoid the hyphen being interpreted as a command line flag because it begins with a hyphen.

On Unix-like systems, you can use the \`--\` argument to indicate that the arguments that follow are not a flag, but rather a query string. For example:

$ gh search issues -- "my-search-query -label:bug"

On PowerShell, you must use both the \`--%\` argument and the \`--\` argument to produce the same effect. For example:

$ gh --% search issues -- "my search query -label:bug"
